Data driven dissipativity verification for a mass-spring-damper system

Data-driven verification by LMIs in Dissipativity_verification.m (requires YALMIP and SDP solver, e.g., MOSEK, SeDuMi,...) 
simulate_system.m is used in Dissipativity_verification.m to draw simulation data
Visualization_set_membership.m generates visualization for set memberships
