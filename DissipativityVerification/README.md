Data driven dissipativity verification for a mass-spring-damper system:

Dissipativity_verification.m: Data-driven verification by LMIs (requires YALMIP and SDP solver, e.g., MOSEK, SeDuMi,...)

simulate_system.m: used in Dissipativity_verification.m to draw simulation data

Visualization_set_membership.m: generates visualization for set memberships
